	<h2>About Sales Management System</h2>
	<p> 
	Adventace, LLC has produced the world’s first SFA/CRM application driven by the processes of a sales management methodology. Through its partnership with salesforce.com, this first version of Adventace SMS was developed to work with salesforce.com's on-demand technology platform. 
	</p> 
	<p> 
	The purpose of the Adventace SMS application is to solve what most people believe is the major problem facing businesses who implement SFA/CRM today: The failure to achieve anticipated results because the technology does not match the business’ sales management processes. With Adventace SMS instead of the technology driving the sales operation, people using highly effective business processes leverage the technology. They are able to input, receive, and immediately react to the critical opportunity based information they need when they need it. 
	</p> 
	<p> 
	Functionally, Adventace SMS provides executives and sales managers with an end-to-end view of their sales operation, allowing them to better manage opportunities and resources, balance pipelines, accurately forecast and, using key performance metrics, measurably improve results throughout their sales operation. Significantly, Adventace SMS also provides strong human resource development functionality designed to measurably improve the performance of sellers, sales managers, and channel managers.
